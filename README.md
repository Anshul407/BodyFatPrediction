# Body Fat Prediction

## Overview

The global challenge of obesity continues to affect millions, and accurate body fat prediction plays a crucial role in addressing this issue. This study focuses on body fat prediction, utilizing machine learning regression models, specifically Ridge Regression, to analyze and predict body fat percentage. The research highlights the importance of achieving both robustness and accuracy when selecting regression algorithms, with Ridge Regression proving to be the superior choice due to its ability to handle outliers effectively.

In addition, the study emphasizes the importance of feature preprocessing, particularly standardization, to enhance the performance of predictive models. A significant discovery from the analysis is the positive relationship between age, body weight, and body fat percentage. By incorporating age as a predictive variable, the model achieves greater accuracy, offering promising implications for improving healthcare and fitness outcomes.

This project aims to refine body fat prediction techniques and explore the impact of age-based assessments for more tailored and precise interventions in the healthcare and fitness sectors.
